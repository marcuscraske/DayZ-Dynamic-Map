DayZ Dynamic Map
=================
A simple dynamic map for "GuruAbdul / DayZ-Private" private server; this simply queries
the database for player and vehicle positions and then updates their positions on a
web-based map using AJAX.

Current issues/potential improvements:
> Needs zoom capability.
> Accuracy with the background map is terrible at north-west (most likely an issue with
  the cut-off values).
> Needs to show player health (perhaps fill the username bar like a health bar).

This project is not guaranteed to be continued, although it may be a useful base or
place for others to contribute. The reason is because DayZ is soon moving away from
the ARMA engine (and hence everything will change) and because GuruAbdul is no
longer maintaining his private server.
